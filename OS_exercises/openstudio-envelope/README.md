# OpenStudio envelope (construction) data
After consructing the geoemetry, the construction of the building envelope needs to be defined. In OpenStudio, this is done by 
1.  defining each material layer of a type of construction (e.g. south facing walls)
2.  ordering the mayerial layer into a construction object
3.  assigning each construction object to the corresponding surface (this includes fenestration)

# Exercise
* Prior to opening OpenStudio, a significant portion of the time spent building a model is collecting the data needed. This first step has been completed in [envelope_data.xlsx](https://github.com/edwardv720/os_workshop/blob/main/OS_exercises/openstudio-envelope/envelope_data.xlsx).
* The steps taken to defining the construction objects and assigning them is shown in [4_os_envelope_exercise.pdf](4_os_envelope_exercise.pdf)
