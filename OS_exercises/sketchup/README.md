# SketchUp
SketchUp is a CAD software and is used with the OpenStudio-SketchUp plug in to build the geometry of the building (walls, roofs, floors, fenestrations)

# Exercise
* The exercise consists of drawing the geometry of a residential semi-detached building (for more background information on the building, see the [.ppt](https://github.com/edwardv720/os_workshop/blob/main/An%20introduction%20to%20%20OpenStudio%20%26%20Energyplus.pptx))
* A set of simplifed plans for the CCHT F house is provided in [CCHT_plans](https://github.com/edwardv720/os_workshop/tree/main/OS_exercises/sketchup/CCHT_plans)
* The steps taken to construct the model can be found in [3_sketchup_exercise.pdf](https://github.com/edwardv720/os_workshop/blob/main/OS_exercises/sketchup/3_sketchup_exercise.pdf)
* The folder [osm_files](https://github.com/edwardv720/os_workshop/tree/main/OS_exercises/sketchup/osm_files) contain .osm of the intermediate steps taken in 3_sketchup_exercise.pdf
