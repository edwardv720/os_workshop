# OpenStudio Excercise - Short
-A short version of the main workshop without supporting BEM background information. This version uses the same Sketchup model found in [here](https://github.com/edwardv720/os_workshop/tree/main/OS_exercises/sketchup) as the starting point; it is saved as `01_ccht_f.osm` in this folder. 

-The tutorial can be found in `tutorial_exercise.docx` and most steps (e.g. 1.6 -- Section 1, step 6) has a corresponding .osm file in this folder (1.6_ccht_f.osm)
