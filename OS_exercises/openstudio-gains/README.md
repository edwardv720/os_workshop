# OpenStudio Internal gains data
Similar to envelope modelling, information on the internal gains of a building needs to be collected prior to modelling in OpenStudio. The information may be more difficult to obtain given the uncertainty of heat gains from different equipment and occupants, in addition to the variance in scheduling.

* The data needed for modelling internal gains have been included in [internal_gains_schedule_data.xlsx](internal_gains_schedule_data.xlsx). In addition, a few of the referenced tables used to obtain this information is provided in [internal_gain_reference_tables.pdf](internal_gain_reference_tables.pdf).
* The steps taken to model internal gains is described in [5_os_internal_gains_exercise.pdf](5_os_internal_gains_exercise.pdf).
* The [osm_files](osm_files) contain the intermediate steps shown in 5_os_internal_gains_exercise.pdf.
