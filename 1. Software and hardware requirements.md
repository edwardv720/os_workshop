# Steps for installation:
### Git
1.	Use the installer to install git

### OpenStudio Application
1.	Use the installer to install the OpenStudio Application
2.	Follow the default configuration

### SketchUp Pro 2021
1.	Make a SketchUp account. You need an SketchUp account and internet connection in order to open it (every time) 
2.	Install SketchUp Pro 2021 (This is a 30-day trial version)

### OpenStudio SketchUp plugin v1.60 *(The plugin is an extra add-on to SketchUp and needs SketchUp Pro 2021 to be installed first)*
1.	Open SketchUp
2.	Sign in
3.	Select the “Architectural Meters” Template (For installation purposes, it doesn’t matter) in the Welcome screen.
4.	In the top menu bar, navigate to: **Extensions > Extensions Manager**
5.	Click on Install Extension and navigate to where the openstudio-sketchup-plugin.rbz is saved and select it.
6.	If it asks, set the path to the OpenStudio Application folder. By default it should be C:\openstudioapplication-1.2.1. This step can cause problems if you have other versions of OpenStudio or the SketchUp-extension installed. Try to use matching versions. You can manually change this in SketchUp later if needed: Extensions>OpenStudio>Preferences.
7.	If it configured properly, these 2 floating tool bars will pop up. You can drag and snap them with the rest of the tool bars.

### DView for OpenStudio Application Results Visualization
1. Unzip DView_windows.zip
2. Open OpenStudio Application > Preferences > Configure External Tools > Set "Path to DView" to where "DView-1.0.0.62e4f87-Windows.exe" is located e.g. `C:/DView_windows/DView-1.0.0.62e4f87-Windows.exe`

### Optional - OpenStudio Parametric Analysis Tool (PAT)
1.	Use the installer and install PAT

### Optional - Docker Desktop
1. Use the installer and follow the prompts
2. After completing the installation, open Docker Desktop for the first time. If you're on windows, it will prompt you to download WSL2 - follow its instructions.
