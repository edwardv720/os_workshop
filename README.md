# Steps for installing:
### Git
1.	Use the installer to install git

### OpenStudio Application
1.	Use the installer to install the OpenStudio Application
2.	Follow the default configuration

### SketchUp Pro 2021
1.	Make a SketchUp account. You need an SketchUp account and internet connection in order to open it (every time) 
2.	Install SketchUp Pro 2021 (This is a 30-day trial version)

### OpenStudio SketchUp plugin v1.21 *(The plugin is an extra add-on to SketchUp and needs SketchUp Pro 2021 to be installed first)*
1.	Open SketchUp
2.	Sign in
3.	Select the “Architectural Meters” Template (For installation purposes, it doesn’t matter) in the Welcome screen.
4.	In the top menu bar, navigate to: **Extensions > Extensions Manager**
5.	Click on Install Extension and navigate to where the openstudio-sketchup-plugin.rbz is saved and select it.
6.	If it asks, set the path to the OpenStudio Application folder. By default it should be C:\openstudioapplication-1.2.1. This step can cause problems if you have other versions of OpenStudio or the SketchUp-extension installed. Try to use matching versions. You can manually change this in SketchUp later if needed: Extensions>OpenStudio>Preferences.
7.	If it configured properly, these 2 floating tool bars will pop up. You can drag and snap them with the rest of the tool bars.
 
### OpenStudio Parametric Analysis Tool (PAT)
1.	Use the installer and install PAT
